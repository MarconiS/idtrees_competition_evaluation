<h2> IDTreeS Data Science competition for identifying trees from remote sensing </h2>

This repo hosts the code for running the evaluation metrics of the 2020 IDTreeS competition. 
To run it on your local machine be sure to have installed all the requirements on your environment; 
you can run the evaluation for both tasks by running the `main(args)` function, 
or by calling `run_segmentation_evaluation(args)` for evaluation of task 1  (detectiona nd segmentation)
and `run_classification_evaluation(args)` for task 2 (species classification)
